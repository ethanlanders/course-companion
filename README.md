## Problem Description
Educators often face challenges in meeting the individual needs of students. Due to no fault of their own, they may lack awareness of how course materials could be inaccessible to some students, and they may struggle to make necessary improvements to enhance accessibility.

## Product Description
Course Companion is a powerful tool designed to help educators improve the accessibility and quality of their course materials. It allows educators to input course materials for in-depth analysis, providing valuable insights and suggestions for enhancement.

### Detailed Analysis
- Total document analysis including word count, bold and italic count, and counts for each level of headers.
- Markdown section analysis including words, sentences, paragraphs, inline code blocks, internal/external links, and code language detection.
- Suggestions for improving accessibility, such as identifying sections with excessive bold or italicized text.

### Report Generation
Once the analysis is complete, Course Companion generates a detailed report containing the analysis while outlining the structure of the document, header levels, and header titles.

## Key Features
- Navigable GUI
- Document analysis for course materials in various file types
- Accessibility suggestions for educators
- Report generation for easy review and reference
- View and save previously generated reports

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyQt5
- Pandoc
